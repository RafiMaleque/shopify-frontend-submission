# The Shoppies App for the Movie Nominations

## Problem
For the Front-end Developer Intern position at Shopify, I was asked to create an app for the application that imitates the Oscars known as 'The Shoppies App' that uses the OMDB API and fetches movie data from it.

## Implementation
### Overview
All the required features that have been implemented:
- Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
- Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
- Updates to the search terms should update the result list
- Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
- If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.

There were extra things I added in:
- Storing nomination data and the theme into local storage
- Added more movie information so that the user is benefitted  more.
- Dark Theme(For Dark theme lovers!!)

### Things I learned from this project
This project helped me understand how important React and Redux are since these tools allow us to handle multiple components in an application which makes a big difference when the application is scaled and complexity increases.
